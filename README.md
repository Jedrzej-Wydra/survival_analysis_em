# A New Way to Calculate Thermal Summation Parameters for Forensically Useful Insects Using Mixture Models with Interval Estimation

## Abstract
Estimating the time of death based on entomological evidence currently involves the use of the so-called “law of total effective temperature”. Application of this method requires knowledge of the development parameters of a given insect taxon. Previously, these parameters were calculated using Campbell’s method. However, Ikemoto and Takai identified three issues with this approach: it does not allow for the estimation of the optimal temperature range, disregards variance variability, and neglects random errors associated with temperature. Consequently, they proposed a new method to replace the one proposed by Campbell. However, this new approach also has some limitations. First, it does not allow for interval estimation of thermal summation parameter k. Due to a high variance in development of insects, point estimates may be of limited practical use. Second, it uses only a small percentage of available data for calculations (usually medians of development time for each temperature), which may lead to an unnecessary reduction of information and weaken results of regression analysis. Third, it assumes a homogeneous population, whereas the latest research indicates that developmental parameters are not constant within the population and depend, for instance, on the size of an insect. In this work, we propose an alternative method that effectively addresses the issues of its predecessors and also enables the detection of so-called component populations in experimental development data. We tested this method on data from previous studies (concerning C. maxillosus and N. littoralis).

## History
This project was a true test of perseverance — like navigating a labyrinth where every turn led to a dead end. We wandered from fuzzy logic to classical statistics, then took a detour into Bayesian methods, only to finally land on mixed models. Each approach seemed promising at first… until it wasn’t. But hey, every wrong turn was just a new lesson in disguise.

I’d love to say this was the last time I’d wrestle with such a problem, but let’s be honest—if history has taught me anything, it’s that complex projects have a way of pulling me right back in. Fingers crossed, though!
