## Abstract
Estimating time of death based on entomological evidence commonly relies on the "law of total effective temperature", which requires developmental parameters of specific insect taxa. These are often calculated using the method of Ikemoto and Takai. However, this approach has key limitations. It assumes a homogeneous population and does not provide meaningful interval estimates, despite substantial variation within species and even populations. Moreover, by aggregating raw data before analysis, it discards valuable information, potentially reducing accuracy. 

In this study, we propose an alternative method that addresses both issues. It estimates interval values for developmental parameters while simultaneously identifying component populations within a dataset. The method involves fitting a finite mixture of Weibull distributions to development time data using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This allows for the inclusion of individual-level variability in the estimation process. 

We tested the method using previously published developmental data on two forensic beetle species, Creophilus maxillosus and Necrodes littoralis (Staphylinidae). Our approach yielded 95% intervals with coverage close to the nominal level, in contrast to Ikemoto and Takai’s method, which captured only 75% and 59% of actual cases, respectively. These findings suggest that our method improves the reliability of insect-based postmortem interval estimates in forensic entomology.

## History
This project was a true test of perseverance — like navigating a labyrinth where every turn led to a dead end. We wandered from fuzzy logic to classical statistics, then took a detour into Bayesian methods, only to finally land on mixed models. Each approach seemed promising at first… until it wasn’t. But hey, every wrong turn was just a new lesson in disguise.

I’d love to say this was the last time I’d wrestle with such a problem, but let’s be honest; if history has taught me anything, it’s that complex projects have a way of pulling me right back in. Fingers crossed, though!
